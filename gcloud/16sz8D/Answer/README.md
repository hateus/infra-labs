```
â”œâ”€â”€ APIGateway
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ .dockerignore
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ docker-entrypoint.sh
â”œâ”€â”€ OrderService
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ .dockerignore
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ docker-entrypoint.sh
â”œâ”€â”€ ProductService

â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ docker-entrypoint.sh
â”œâ”€â”€ cloudbuild-pr.yaml
â””â”€â”€ cloudbuild.yaml
```
